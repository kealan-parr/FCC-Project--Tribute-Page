<p > Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander III of Macedon was a king of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty/royal house. He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years, on a miltary campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, creating one of the largest empires of the ancient world, at the mere age of 30. </p>
<p> He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most succesful military commanders.</p>
<p> Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16. After Philip's assassination (his father) in 336 BC, he ascended to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his army in the conquest of Persia. </p>
<p> In 334 BC, he invaded the Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River.
<p> He endeavored to reach the "ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. </p>
